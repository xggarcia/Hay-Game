# Hay-Game

Extra implementations to the game:

1) In order to have a more interesting game with some difficulty and that you are able to compete with others, each time a sheep spawns, the time between spawns is descreased by 0,05s. (having as limit 1s)

2) You have a pause option during the game. Just by pressing P the game stops.
